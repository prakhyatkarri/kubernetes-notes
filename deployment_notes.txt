Rolling Update: Destroy one and create one. Repeat for all pods. No app downtime.

kubectl set image deployment/<deployment> <image> # Not recommended
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment>

Rollback to previous:
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment>


kubectl get replicaset # Verify replicasets status


kubectl run nginx --image=nginx # deployment "nginx" created
