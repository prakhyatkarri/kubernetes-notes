Networking:
IP address is assigned to a Node
IP address is assigned to a POD
Ex: Internal Private Network -> 10.244.0.0 -> sample pod has 10.244.0.2 -> Interal IP


Rules:
All containers/pods communicate with each other without NAT
All nodes communicate with each other/viceversa without NAT
A network/routing layer should be installed between nodes
kubectl get pods -o wide # displays Node and IP information
